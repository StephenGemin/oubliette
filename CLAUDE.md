# lnotes

A minimal POSIX C CLI note manager. Notes are plain Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
Keep it small, portable, and dependency-free.

## Project structure

```
src/main.c      CLI entry point and command dispatch
src/notes.c     collect_all_notes, cmd_add, cmd_remove, cmd_list
src/notes.h     shared Note struct, constants, all declarations
src/search.c    cmd_search
src/utils.c     get_notes_dir (storage path logic), parse_frontmatter,
                generate_id, title_to_slug, open_in_editor
tests/test_main.c      C unit tests
tests/test_scripts.sh  shell integration tests
scripts/install.sh     install logic
scripts/uninstall.sh   uninstall logic
```

## Build

```sh
make
make clean
make install   # installs to ~/.local/bin/notes
make test
make uninstall
```

## Constraints
* C99 or later; compile cleanly with both gcc and clang.
* Standard library and POSIX APIs only. No external libraries, no vendored code.
* No CMake, Autotools, Meson, pkg-config, Homebrew packages, or apt dependencies.
* Target: Linux and macOS. No GNU-only or platform-specific APIs.
* Avoid fixed-size path buffers; handle PATH_MAX carefully.
* No global mutable state.

## Storage
* Path precedence — keep this logic in one place, not scattered across commands:
  * LNOTES_DIR
  * XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR/lnotes (Linux)
  * ~/Documents/lnotes
* Do not perform destructive operations unless the command explicitly requests it.
* Preserve existing Markdown body content when editing metadata.

## Note format

```yaml
---
title: Example title
created: 2026-06-23T12:00:00Z
updated: 2026-06-23T12:00:00Z
---
```

Body follows the closing `---`. Simple key/value parsing is sufficient; no full YAML parser.

## CLI conventions
Minimal, obvious commands:
```sh
notes add "Title" [-c <category>]
notes rm  <id|title>
notes ls  [-v] [-c <category>]
notes search <pattern> [-c <cat>] [-t] [-b]
```
Do not add flags or subcommands without a clear current need.
Do not rename commands, flags, or environment variables without being asked.
Error messages must be actionable: notes: could not open file: <path>, not just error.

## Code style
- `static` for file-local functions.
- Explicit, predictable ownership for allocated memory.
- Clear names over abbreviations.

## Testing
- Small POSIX shell tests or simple C tests via `make test`. Do not introduce a test framework.
- New features require tests.

## Documentation
- When a new feature is complete and agreed upon, check `README.md` and update it to reflect the change.
- When the project directory structure changes and those changes are agreed upon, update the `## Project structure` section in this file.
- Do not update documentation speculatively — only after the implementation or structure change is finalized.

## Pull requests
- Builds with `make`.
- Tests pass.
- New features have tests.
- Diff is focused; no formatting churn, no build artifacts, no editor or cache files.
